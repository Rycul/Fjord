How to use
-----

Currently it is recommended to install the [MultiVerse plugin for CraftBukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/) alongside Fjord.
You can then create a world using the command:

`/mv create <worldname> normal -g Fjord -s <seed>`

To teleport a player (including yourself) to the newly created Fjord world, use:

`/mv tp <playername> <worldname>`

For more MultiVerse commands, see the MultiVerse external link.
