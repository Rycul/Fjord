(Craft)Bukkit scandinavian/fjord-like terrain-generator plugin

-----

Fjord is a terrain-generator plugin aimed at providing terrain somewhat similar to scandinavian [fjords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord) and highland.

How to use
-----

Currently it is recommended to install the [MultiVerse plugin for CraftBukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/) alongside Fjord.
You can then create a world using the command:

`/mv create <worldname> normal -g Fjord`
